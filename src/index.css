/* --- MOBILE CURSOR FIX ---
  This CSS is a crucial fallback. 
  
  Your App.jsx has a `cursor-none` class to hide the default mouse cursor on desktops.
  This media query targets devices with touch screens (where `pointer` is `coarse`)
  and restores the default system cursor (`cursor: auto`), so you don't end up with
  no cursor at all on mobile.
*/
@media (pointer: coarse) {
  .cursor-none {
    cursor: auto;
  }
